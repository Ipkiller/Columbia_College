lagatha is featured in the show Vikings

and is portrayed as a warrior with

unmatched skill

but how did she actually live according

to the sources the book The Deeds of the

Danes outlines some of her life

was born in a legendary and fabled era

and she would wet her sword with the

likes of Ragnar Lothbrok and other

celebrated Heroes

the tale of lagatha begins when fro the

king of Sweden invaded Norway in the

battle that followed Seward the king

would receive an incurable wound and

would die a few days afterwards Ragnar

and his family would soon receive a huge

disrespect fro the king of Sweden would

put the wives of siwad's kinsfolk and

friends in a brothel in order to

humiliate them even in death

when Ragnar heard of this he was

outraged and he went on a quest in order

to avenge the death of his relatives

free they're still living women who at

this point were still bound to disgrace

King fro had abused many women's folk

and when Ragnarok called his mental War

many women dressed themselves in men's

clothing preferring death over the way

they were being treated

Ragnar understood the outrage of many of

the women and allowed them to fight

for the author of their pain was also

his enemy and he wouldn't punish the

women but would fight with them for the

sake of vengeance

among one of the women who answered

Ragnar's call to war was lagatha who was

described as a skilled Amazon to put to

this into perspective in Greek mythology

Amazons were a group of female warriors

and Hunters who beat men in Physical

Agility strength archery riding skills

and the Arts of combat lagatha who

although was a maiden had the courage of

a man and when the time came for battle

against King fro she fought in the front

line amongst the bravest with her hair

loose over her shoulders the whole Army

would Marvel at her matchless Deeds for

her locks flying down her back betrayed

that she was a woman

once the battle was over and Ragnar had

Avenged his family he asked many

questions to his fellow soldiers

concerning the maiden who he had seen

fighting in the front lines he declared

that the victory was gained by her might

he learned that she was a woman of noble

birth Among The Barbarians and tried to

woo her by means of Messengers

lagatha would pretend she was interested

in Ragnar but she would also put a dog

and a bear to guard her house in order

for her would-be lover to not have easy

access to her

Ragnar would Embark across the sea until

finally he reached the valley in which

Lagertha resided

he told his men to allow him to confront

her alone and there he was met by two

beasts a bear and a Hound Ragnar was not

afraid and he thrust his spear at the

bear and once it was slain he choked the

Hound to death lagatha respected him for

the Peril he had overcome the couple

would marry and they had two daughters

whose names have been lost to time but

they also had a son named freed leaf and

they would live for three years together

in peace

after a time however Ragnar would fall

in love with another woman named Thora

the daughter of King Herod of Sweden and

he divorced lagatha remembering that she

had set two Savage beasts to kill him

Ragnar would soon return to Denmark but

he would be faced with a Civil War the

jutes and the scanians had plotted

against Ragnar during his time of

absence

and had given a man called Harold the

title of King

Ragnar knew war was coming and he sent

envoys to Norway to gather fighting men

the situation was hopeless and he

thought himself destitute of all

resources and had to borrow help from

folk of every age

amongst his ranks were the strong and

the feeble The Young and the old

Ragnar would soon engage the rebels in

battle

he first met the scanians on the field

where he had a hard fight

lagatha heard that Ragnar was in dire

need and her love for him was still as

strong as ever she would gather her own

men and quickly came to his Aid bringing

120 ships

lagatha was described as having a

matchless spirit even though she had a

delicate frame

she covered her Splendid bravery at the

inclination of the soldiers to waver

for she made a Sally about and flew

round to the rear of the enemy making

them unawares and thus turned the Panic

of her friends into the camp of the

enemy this description of lagatha from

the guest of denorum indicates that

lagatha saved Ragnar in the height of

the battle with a counter-attack

Ragnar's son who was the commander of a

part of the army Seward was wounded and

therefore slacked morale with lager for

charging into the enemy with her

soldiers she motivated Ragnar's Force to

carry on

and at last the usurper King Harold's

Army was broken and their men would

retreat they were rooted however

and Harold himself was slain and most of

his men were slaughtered

after the battle lagatha went home and

murdered her new husband in the night

with a spearhead which she had hidden in

her gown

she then usurped his title name and

sovereignty as she thought it better to

rule without her husband than to share

the throne with him

and so ends the tale of lagtha she was

the savior of Ragnar and fought

alongside him twice in battle both times

being the reason the battle was won

the show Vikings portrays lagatha as a

shield Maiden which is accurate but in

the show she is in countless battles and

has a song called Bjorn when according

to the sources Ragnar and lagatha's son

was called freed leaf there are also

other inconsistencies such as her going

to Wessex and other raids which were

never documented

but due to there not being much on

lagatha in the guest of denorum it gives

the showrunners freedom to do a lot with

the character

although the last we hear of lagatha is

that she murders her husband and takes

his throne

a woman ruling during this period in

early medieval Scandinavia was very rare

which just goes to show how respected

and admired she was we even see this in

the writing of the guested anorum with

my favorite line being the whole Army

would Marvel at her matchless Deeds

for her locks flying down her back the

trade that she was a woman
