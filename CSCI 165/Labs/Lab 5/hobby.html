                        I live deeply within my head & once my creativity peaks, 
                        I write many varied words & sentences. 
                        It seems I enter into a trance-like state. And, as a result, 
                        I put those words together and it turns into a poem. Once I have 3 to 4 paragraphs, 
                        I can begin to edit those words. It is very useful to create a title first, 
                        that way you can decide how you want your poem structured. 
                        Lastly, it's not necessary to rhyme for the poem to have meaning. 
                        Although I find it useful to use rhyming at every other line. 
                        To use rhyming can give you somewhere to go.
